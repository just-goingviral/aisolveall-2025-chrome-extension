_Last Updated: [Insert Date]_

These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the Aisolveall Assistant Chrome Extension ("Extension"). By installing or using this Extension, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, do not install or use the Extension.

## 1. Use of the Extension

- **License:**  
  Aisolveall Assistant is licensed to you for personal, non-commercial use only. You may not distribute, modify, or use the Extension for any commercial purpose without explicit permission.

- **API Keys and Data:**  
  The Extension integrates with external APIs (such as OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Perplexity, and ElevenLabs). You are responsible for obtaining and securely storing your own API keys. The developers of this Extension do not assume responsibility for the misuse of these keys.

- **Local Storage:**  
  The Extension may store data locally on your device (including chat histories and project data). You are solely responsible for the security and backup of this data.

## 2. Provider Integrations

- **OpenAI:**  
  The Extension uses OpenAI’s Chat Completions API and supports the latest models (e.g., GPT 3.5 Turbo, GPT 4). Use of OpenAI’s services is subject to OpenAI’s own Terms of Service.

- **Anthropic, Gemini, and Perplexity:**  
  Integrations with Anthropic, Gemini, and Perplexity are provided as options. Full functionality depends on valid API keys and endpoints. These integrations may require additional backend security. By using these features, you agree that you have read and accepted the terms of the respective providers.

## 3. Security and Data Privacy

- **Security:**  
  We implement basic security measures (such as a strict Content Security Policy) to help protect against unauthorized code execution. However, we do not guarantee absolute security.

- **Disclaimer:**  
  The Extension is provided "as is" without warranty of any kind. We are not liable for any damages, loss of data, or security breaches resulting from the use of this Extension.

## 4. Modifications

We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. Any changes will be posted in an updated version of these Terms. Your continued use of the Extension constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.

## 5. Governing Law

These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction in which the developer operates.
