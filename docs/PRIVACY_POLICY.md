# Privacy Policy

_Last Updated: March 10, 2025_

This Privacy Policy describes how the Aisolveall Assistant Chrome Extension ("Extension") collects, uses, and stores your data. By using the Extension, you consent to the practices described in this policy.

## 1. Data Collection and Storage

### Local Data Storage

The Extension stores data locally on your device. This includes:
- Chat histories
- Project data and contexts
- User preferences
- Any other information you choose to save while using the Extension

No personal data is transmitted to our servers.

### API Interactions

The Extension makes calls to external APIs (such as OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Perplexity, and ElevenLabs) using your own API keys. We do not store or log your API keys on our servers. Please note that these third-party services may have their own privacy policies that govern how they handle your data and requests.

## 2. Use of Data

### Chat History and Projects

All chat history and project information is stored locally and is used to provide context for your queries. This data remains on your device unless you choose to export or share it.

### Voice Data

When using the voice input feature, audio is processed locally by your browser's Web Speech API. When using text-to-speech features, text is sent to ElevenLabs using your API key.

### No Data Sharing

We do not share your locally stored data with any third parties. All information remains on your device.

## 3. Security

### Content Security Policy

The Extension enforces a strict Content Security Policy to help protect against malicious code injection.

### API Keys

It is important that you do not share your API keys with others. The Extension stores your API keys locally in the browser's storage. For production use, we recommend using a secure backend or proxy to manage API keys. The Extension is provided "as is" without any guarantees regarding security.

## 4. User Control

### Local Control

You have full control over the data stored by the Extension. You can:
- Clear your chat history
- Delete projects
- Modify saved prompts
- Export and import your data

These actions can be performed through the Extension's interface or through your browser's local storage management tools.

## 5. Browser Permissions

This Extension requires the following permissions:
- Storage: To store your chat history and preferences
- ActiveTab: To interact with the current tab
- Clipboard: To copy responses to your clipboard
- Notifications: To notify you of completed operations

## 6. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in an updated version of this document with a new "Last Updated" date. Your continued use of the Extension after any changes indicates your acceptance of the updated policy.
