# Privacy Policy

_Last Updated: March 7, 2025_

This Privacy Policy describes how the Aisolveall Assistant Chrome Extension ("Extension") collects, uses, and stores your data. By using the Extension, you consent to the practices described in this policy.

## 1. Data Collection and Storage

- **Local Data Storage:**
  The Extension stores data locally on your device. This includes chat histories, project data, and any other information you choose to save while using the Extension. No personal data is transmitted to our servers.

- **API Interactions:**
  The Extension makes calls to external APIs (such as OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Perplexity, and ElevenLabs) using your own API keys. We do not store or log your API keys. Please note that these third-party services may have their own privacy policies.

## 2. Use of Data

- **Chat History and Projects:**
  All chat history and project information is stored locally and is used to provide context for your queries. This data remains on your device unless you choose to export or share it.

- **No Data Sharing:**
  We do not share your locally stored data with any third parties. All information remains on your device.

## 3. Security

- **Content Security Policy:**
  The Extension enforces a strict Content Security Policy to help protect against malicious code injection.

- **API Keys:**
  It is important that you do not hard-code sensitive API keys in the Extension's code for production use. We recommend using a secure backend or proxy to manage API keys. The Extension is provided "as is" without any guarantees regarding security.

## 4. User Control

- **Local Control:**
  You have full control over the data stored by the Extension. You can clear your chat history and project data through your browser's local storage management tools.

## 5. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in an updated version of this document. Your continued use of the Extension after any changes indicates your acceptance of the updated policy.
